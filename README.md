# Cognitive-decline-D-CVAE
This repository contains the implementation of the Disentangled Conditional Variational Autoencoder (D-CVAE) for clinically interpretable prediction of cognitive impairment stages (CN, MCI, AD). The model fuses neuropsychological scores and demographic data while learning a disentangled latent representation that aligns with disease progression.
